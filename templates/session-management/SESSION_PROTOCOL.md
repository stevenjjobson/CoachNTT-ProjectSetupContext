# üöÄ Session Protocol: Start to Completion Guide

## Overview

This document provides standardized protocols for AI-assisted development sessions. Following these protocols ensures smooth session transitions, complete documentation, and prevents context loss.

## üìã Pre-Session Checklist

Before starting any session:

- [ ] Review previous session notes and completion status
- [ ] Check for any pending tasks or unresolved issues  
- [ ] Verify development environment is ready
- [ ] Identify session goals and expected deliverables
- [ ] Estimate context requirements and plan checkpoints

## üéØ Session Start Protocol

### 1. Session Initialization Template

```markdown
## Session X.X: [Session Name]

### Context Plan
**Estimated Output**: ~XXXX lines  
**Context Budget**: ~XX% of window
**Commit Points**: 
- [ ] Component 1 complete (~XX%)
- [ ] Component 2 complete (~XX%)
- [ ] Tests and documentation (~XX%)
- [ ] Final cleanup and commit (~XX%)

### Session Goals
1. [Primary deliverable]
2. [Secondary deliverable]
3. [Testing/documentation requirement]

Starting implementation...
```

### 2. Context Awareness Declaration

Always begin with realistic estimates:

```markdown
Based on the scope of work:
- Core implementation: ~XXX lines
- Tests: ~XXX lines  
- Documentation: ~XXX lines
- Total estimate: ~XXXX lines (~XX% of context)

This leaves XX% buffer for:
- Debugging and fixes
- Additional features
- Documentation updates
```

### 3. Living Documentation Start

Create/update session tracking immediately:

```markdown
## Session Progress

### Started: [Timestamp]
- [ ] Environment setup verified
- [ ] Previous session reviewed
- [ ] Goals documented
- [ ] Context budget planned

### Implementation Track
- [ ] [First component]
- [ ] [Second component]
- [ ] [Tests]
- [ ] [Documentation]
```

## üìä Mid-Session Management

### Progress Update Format

Every 25-30% of context used:

```markdown
## Progress Update

‚úÖ Completed:
- Component A (XXX lines)
- Tests for Component A (XXX lines)

üìä Context Status:  
- Used: ~XX%
- Remaining: ~XX%
- On track: Yes/No

üéØ Next:
- Component B implementation
- Integration tests
```

### Checkpoint Decision Protocol

When reaching natural break points:

```markdown
üí° Checkpoint Opportunity

Current state:
- ‚úÖ [Component] complete and tested
- ‚úÖ Code in working state
- üìä Context at XX% usage

Recommend committing progress before continuing.
This ensures work is preserved and provides clean restart point.

Shall I proceed with commit?
```

### Context Warning Levels

Proactive communication at usage thresholds:

```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Context at 70% usage

Prioritizing essential tasks:
1. Complete current function
2. Add minimal tests
3. Update documentation
4. Prepare for commit

Deferring to next session:
- Additional features
- Comprehensive testing
- Detailed documentation
```

## üèÅ Session Completion Protocol

```

## üîÑ Session Handoff Protocol

### 1. Continuation File

Create clear handoff documentation:

```markdown
# Session Continuation: X.Y

## Previous Session (X.X) Status
- **Completed**: [What was finished]
- **Partial**: [What was started but not completed]
- **Blocked**: [What couldn't be done and why]

## Current System State

- **In Progress**: [What's partially implemented]
- **Not Started**: [What's still planned]

## Priority for This Session
1. [Most critical task]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Required Context
- Files: `[file1.py, file2.py]`
- Documentation: `[relevant.md]`
- Previous decisions: [Key choices made]

## Known Constraints
- [Technical limitation]
- [Dependency issue]
- [Time/context constraint]
```

### 2. Environment State

Document the development environment:

```markdown
## Environment Snapshot

### Running Services
- Database: [Status and connection info]
- API: [Endpoint and status]
- Tests: [Test framework status]

### Key Commands
```bash
# Start services
[command]

### Progress Tracking

Maintain overall feature progress:

```markdown
## Feature Progress Tracker

### Overall Status: 40% Complete

| Session | Status | Lines | Tests | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| X.1 | ‚úÖ Complete | 1,487 | 15/15 | Core models done |
| X.2 | üîÑ In Progress | 743/2000 | 5/20 | Validation pending |
| X.3 | ‚è≥ Planned | 0/1500 | 0/15 | Blocked by X.2 |
| X.4 | ‚è≥ Planned | 0/1000 | 0/10 | - |

### Blockers
1. X.2 delayed due to requirement clarification
2. Test environment issues affecting progress

### Adjusted Timeline
- Original: 4 sessions
- Revised: 5 sessions (added X.2.5 for additional logic)
```

## üö® Emergency Protocols

### Context Exhaustion

When approaching 95% context usage:

```markdown
üö® CONTEXT CRITICAL - Emergency Completion

1. STOP all new development
2. Ensure current code compiles
3. Add minimal documentation:
   ```
   # TODO: Session ended at context limit
   # Status: [Current state]
   # Next: [What needs to be done]
   ```
4. Commit immediately with message:
   "Emergency commit: Context exhaustion at [feature]"
5. Create continuation notes
```

### System Failure

If development environment fails:

```markdown
## System Failure Protocol

1. Document current state in plain text
2. Save all uncommitted changes
3. Note the exact failure point
4. Create recovery checklist:
   - [ ] Last working state
   - [ ] Changes made since
   - [ ] Error messages
   - [ ] Recovery steps tried
```

## üí° Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Start with realistic estimates
- ‚úÖ Update progress regularly
- ‚úÖ Commit at natural boundaries
- ‚úÖ Document decisions and rationale
- ‚úÖ Leave code in working state
- ‚úÖ Create clear handoff notes

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Skip progress updates
- ‚ùå Exceed 85% context without warning
- ‚ùå Leave code in broken state
- ‚ùå Forget to document blockers
- ‚ùå Make optimistic estimates
- ‚ùå Skip the completion checklist

## üìù Quick Reference Card

```markdown
## Session Quick Reference

### Start
1. Review previous session
2. Declare context budget
3. Set clear goals

### During  
- Update at 25% intervals
- Checkpoint at component boundaries
- Watch context usage

### End
1. Complete checklist
2. Write summary
3. Prepare handoff
4. Commit with structure

### Always

```

Remember: Good session protocol ensures every session builds successfully on the previous one, creating sustainable long-term development velocity.
