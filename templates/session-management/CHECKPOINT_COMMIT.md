## Checkpoint Decision Guide

### When to Checkpoint

Create a checkpoint when:
- ‚úÖ Major component is complete and tested
- ‚úÖ Context usage reaches 60-70%
- ‚úÖ Natural break point in implementation
- ‚úÖ Before starting unrelated component
- ‚úÖ Complex changes that work but need review
- ‚úÖ End of time-boxed work period

### When NOT to Checkpoint

Avoid checkpoints when:
- ‚ùå Code doesn't compile or run
- ‚ùå Tests are failing
- ‚ùå In the middle of a logical change
- ‚ùå Temporary debug code is present
- ‚ùå Documentation is inconsistent with code

## Pre-Checkpoint Checklist

### Code State
- [ ] All syntax errors resolved
- [ ] Functions have proper returns
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Debug statements removed
- [ ] TODOs are clearly marked

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new code
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Error handling in place

### Documentation
- [ ] Function docstrings updated
- [ ] README reflects changes
- [ ] API changes documented
- [ ] Complex logic commented

### Version Control
- [ ] Changes staged appropriately
- [ ] No sensitive data included
- [ ] Branch is up to date
- [ ] Commit message prepared

## Checkpoint Types

### 1. Feature Checkpoint
```
[Session X.X] Checkpoint: [Feature] implementation complete

Feature "[Feature Name]" is now functional with:
- Core logic implemented
- Basic tests passing
- API endpoints working
- Documentation updated

Ready for integration testing in next session.
```

### 2. Refactor Checkpoint
```
[Session X.X] Checkpoint: [Component] refactoring complete

Refactored [Component] for:
- Better performance ([metric])
- Cleaner architecture
- Improved maintainability

All tests passing, no functionality changes.
```

### 3. Foundation Checkpoint
```
[Session X.X] Checkpoint: Project foundation established

Created initial structure:
- Project layout complete
- Core models defined
- Basic infrastructure ready
- Development environment configured

Ready to implement features.
```

### 4. Integration Checkpoint
```
[Session X.X] Checkpoint: [System A] + [System B] integrated

Successfully connected:
- [System A] now talks to [System B]
- Data flow validated
- Error handling implemented
- Integration tests passing
```

### 5. Emergency Checkpoint
```
[Session X.X] Emergency Checkpoint: Context at [XX]%

PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- [What's complete]
- [What's partially done]
- [What's not started]

TODO: [Specific next steps]
ISSUE: [Any blocking problems]

Continue from [specific file/function]
```

## Post-Checkpoint Actions

### 1. Verify Checkpoint
```bash
# Verify code state
git status
git diff --staged

# Run quick tests
[test command]

# Check build
[build command]
```

### 2. Document Continuation Point
```markdown
## Next Session Start Point

Resume from:
- File: [filename]
- Function: [function name]
- Line: [approximate line]

Next task:
- [ ] [Specific next action]
- [ ] [Following action]

Context needed:
- [File 1]
- [File 2]
```

### 3. Update Progress Tracking
```markdown
## Progress Update

Checkpoint created at:
- Time: [timestamp]
- Context: [XX]% used
- Completed: [X]/[Y] planned items

Remaining work:
- [ ] [Item 1] (~[XXX] lines)
- [ ] [Item 2] (~[XXX] lines)
```

## Quick Checkpoint Commands

```bash
# Create checkpoint commit
git add .
git commit -m "[Session X.X] Checkpoint: [description]"

# Tag important checkpoints
git tag -a "checkpoint-session-X.X" -m "Major milestone: [description]"

# Push checkpoint
git push origin [branch]
git push --tags
```

## Checkpoint Recovery

If you need to return to a checkpoint:

```bash
# List checkpoints
git log --oneline --grep="Checkpoint"

# Return to checkpoint
git checkout [commit-hash]

# Create branch from checkpoint
git checkout -b continue-from-checkpoint [commit-hash]
```

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Keep checkpoint commits atomic
- ‚úÖ Include context percentage in message
- ‚úÖ Document what's NOT done
- ‚úÖ Test before committing
- ‚úÖ Make checkpoints recoverable

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Checkpoint broken code
- ‚ùå Mix feature changes in checkpoint
- ‚ùå Forget to document continuation
- ‚ùå Skip testing
- ‚ùå Create huge checkpoint commits

Remember: A good checkpoint is like a game save - you should be able to pick up exactly where you left off.
